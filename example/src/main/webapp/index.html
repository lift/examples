  <h2>Welcome to the <i>Lift</i> Web Framework</h2>
  <p><i>Lift</i> provides the best features for building interactive
    web applications:
    <ul>
      <li>
	Super simple and wicked powerful <a href="/ajax">Ajax</a> and
	Comet coding.  This lets you build more interactive, user-friendly
	sites.
      </li>
      <li>
	Amazingly concise code with the powerful type-safety
	of <a href="http://scala-lang.org">Scala</a>.  This means
	more time spent coding features
	and less time writing tests or chasing
	parameter mis-matches.
      </li>
      <li>
	Runs on all standard JEE (Java) application servers
	including Jetty, Tomcat, WebLogic, etc.
	This means you get the performance, scalability and
	compatibility of the best web infrastructure around.
      </li>
      <li>
	Built-in security means more time focusing on your
	application and less time being defensive about
	parameter tampering, SQL injection, Cross Site Scripting and
	other nasty attacks.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
<br/>
  <p><i>Lift</i> is built on <a href='http://scala-lang.org'>Scala</a>, a hybrid Functional and 
    O-O language that compiles code down to the Java Virtual Machine.
    Scala code can call any Java code and make use of all Java classes.
    Java code can call some Scala code. <i>Lift</i> applications are packaged as WAR files and 
    can be deployed on any
    Servlet 2.4 engine (e.g., Tomcat 5.5.xx, Jetty 6.0, etc.)</p>
  
  <p><i>Lift</i> code is as clean and brief as Rails, yet performs at least 6 
    times faster and
    is multithreaded.  Additionally, because Scala is strongly typed, 
    the compiler
    catches type errors.  For example:<br/>
    <code>
      <pre>
	User.find(By(User.email, "foo@bar.com")) // legal
	User.find(By(User.birthday, new Date("Jan 4, 1975"))) // legal
	User.find(By(User.birthday, "foo@bar.com")) // compiler error
      </pre>
    </code>
