<p>The following is David Pollak's take on web framework view technology:</p>
<div class="dpp_stuff">
<p>The Lift design is born out of my experience (both good and bad)  
with a variety of technologies including Rails.
</p><p>I think the best paper on the subject is Terrence Parr's work on  

<a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.stringtemplate.org/" rel="nofollow">StringTemplate</a>.
</p><p>My first design goal with Lift was to make sure that no programming  
logic and no programming symbols make it into the static display  
templates.
</p><p>ERB and JSP and ASP all have the fatal flaw of allowing code in the  
view.  This is bad for a bunch of reasons.  First, it makes editing  
the templates difficult with HTML layout tools unless those tools are  
familiar with the syntax being used.  Second, there are "foreign"  
symbols in the layout, which tends to be less than optimal for the  
HTML designers. (On the Rails side of things, every Rails team I've  
seen has a Ruby coder that also does the design.  While this is the  
norm in the Rails community, it is the exception when team sizes are  
more than 2 or 3.)  Third, every single Rails, JSP, and ASP project  
I've ever seen (and I've been seeing them for a very long time) has  
some non-trivial amount of business logic creep into the display.   
Fourth, Scala has a very nice type system and when the type system is  
used correctly, the compiler finds a lot of program errors, but when  
the code is buried in templates, one has a much more difficult time  
using the powerful Scala compiler tools.
</p><p>So, the static templates in Lift are strictly display only.  They can  
be manipulated with standard design tools (e.g., Dreamweaver).  They  
can never contain program logic.
</p><p>Some asides.
</p><p>First, I rejected using StringTemplate (or something like it) because  
it introduced some programming into the templating mechanism and it  
would have taken a lot of work to make it XMLTemplate (and all of  
Lift's templating is XHTML and makes use of Scala's excellent support  
of XML.)
</p><p>Second, I've been referring to static templates.  Lift has a little  
known and pretty much undocumented feature that supports template  
generation from Scala code.  One of these days, I'll document the  
feature and put up some examples.
</p><p>Third, Rails' "controller first" dispatch mechanism makes the  
assumption that there is only one piece of "logic" on the page and  
the rest is decoration.  My experience doing web work is just the  
opposite.  There are typically 3 or more of pieces of logic on a page  
(dynamic menu bars, search boxes, shopping cart, real-time chat,  
etc.) and having to choose which piece of logic make the "controller"  
is less than optimal.
</p><p>So, the quintessential use of Lift's templates are as follows:
</p>
<code><pre class="html">
&lt;html&gt;
...
&lt;lift:show.myForm form=&quot;post&quot;&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;f:name&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;/&gt;&lt;/f:name&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Birthyear&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;f:year&gt;&lt;select&gt;&lt;option&gt;2007&lt;/option&gt;&lt;option&gt;2006&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;&lt;/f:year&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Add&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/lift:show.myForm&gt;
...

&lt;/html&gt;
</pre></code>
<p>So we've got a Lift snippet invocation with the valid HTML form and  
some additional tags.  So far (with the proper namespace  
declarations) this page is valid XHTML.  This page can be viewed in a  
browser or opened and edited in Dreamweaver.
</p><p>In Lift, the snippet is the equivalent of a Rails controller: it is  
the instantiation of a class and invocation of a method on the  
class.  Because you can have multiple snippets on a page, you can  
call out multiple logic streams on a given page and there's no need  
to choose the "primary" logic stream.
</p><p>The 'form="post"' attribute is a shortcut.  It automatically wraps  
the enclosed XHTML in a &lt;form method='post' target={current page...  
it's a post-back}&gt;...&lt;/form&gt; tag.
</p><p>The &lt;f:.../&gt; tags are bind points for the business logic.  They allow  
your snippet to easily replace the tag and its children with what is  
supposed to be displayed.  This mechanism is a little heavier than  
Wicket's mechanism for binding display elements to logic and I've got  
a to-do to make Lift's mechanism work like Wickets as well... but  
that's a digression.
</p><p>So, your Lift code will look like:
</p>

<code><pre class="scala">
class Show {
   def myForm(xhtml: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = {
     var name = &quot;&quot;
     def handleYear(year: String) {
       ... the form's been submitted... do something
     }
     Helpers.bind(&quot;f&quot;, xhtml, &quot;name&quot; -&gt; SHtml.text(name, name = _),
                   &quot;year&quot; -&gt; SHtml.select((1900 to 2007).toList.reverse.map(v =&gt; (v.toString, v.toString)), 
                                       Empty, handleYear _))
   }
}

</pre></code>
<p>Note that no display code has crept into the snippet.  You've simply  
bound the HTML created by text() and select() to the &lt;f:name/&gt; and  
&lt;f:year/&gt; tags in the incoming XHTML.
</p><p>Also, you've bound two functions (the anonymous function <code>name = _</code> and  
handleYear) to the HTML form elements.  When the form is POSTed,  
these functions (which are bound to local variables) will be  
statefully invoked.
</p><p>If you are displaying a table rather than a  
form, then the same binding logic still works.  For example:
</p>
<code><pre class="html">
&lt;table&gt;

&lt;lift:snippet type=&quot;show:users&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;f:first_name&gt;David&lt;/f:first_name&gt;&lt;/ 
td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;f:last_name&gt;Pollak&lt;/f:last_name&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/lift:snippet&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;
</pre></code>
<code><pre class="scala">
class Show {
   def users(xhtml: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = Users.findAll.flatMap(user =&gt; bind(&quot;f&quot;, 
             xhtml, &quot;first_name&quot; --&gt; user.firstName, &quot;last_name&quot; --&gt; user.nameName))
}

</pre></code>
<p>If you take the time to clearly define the bind points, then you can  
have no display code at all in your snippets.
</p><p>Can display logic slip into a snippet?  Yes, and as you've seen and  
pointed out, the examples are less than optimal in this regard.
</p><p>Has display logic ever crept into a method called from an ERB  
template?  Yes, and very often it's a source of a potential Cross  
Site Scripting vulnerability.
</p><p>Has business logic ever crept into an ERB template?  Yes.
</p><p>In Lift, display can creep into a snippet, but business logic cannot  
creep into a the static display template.  Yes, your designers will  
still have to police putting display logic in the snippet code, but  
the coders will not have to police business logic in the templates.
