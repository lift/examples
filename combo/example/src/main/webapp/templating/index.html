      </p>
    </div>

    <p>The following is David Pollak's take on web framework view technology:</p>

    <div class="dpp_stuff">
      <p>The Lift design is born out of my experience (both good and bad) with a variety of technologies including
        Rails.
      </p>
      <p>I think the best paper on the subject is Terrence Parr's work on

        <a href="http://www.stringtemplate.org/" class="external text" title="http://www.stringtemplate.org/" rel="nofollow">StringTemplate</a>.
      </p>
      <p>My first design goal with Lift was to make sure that no programming logic and no programming symbols make it
        into the
        static display templates.
      </p>
      <p>ERB and JSP and ASP all have the fatal flaw of allowing code in the view. This is bad for a bunch of reasons.
        First,
        it makes editing the templates difficult with HTML layout tools unless those tools are familiar with the syntax
        being
        used. Second, there are "foreign" symbols in the layout, which tends to be less than optimal for the HTML
        designers.
        (On the Rails side of things, every Rails team I've seen has a Ruby coder that also does the design. While this
        is
        the norm in the Rails community, it is the exception when team sizes are more than 2 or 3.) Third, every single
        Rails,
        JSP, and ASP project I've ever seen (and I've been seeing them for a very long time) has some non-trivial
        amount
        of business logic creep into the display. Fourth, Scala has a very nice type system and when the type system is
        used
        correctly, the compiler finds a lot of program errors, but when the code is buried in templates, one has a much
        more
        difficult time using the powerful Scala compiler tools.
      </p>
      <p>So, the static templates in Lift are strictly display only. They can be manipulated with standard design tools
        (e.g.,
        Dreamweaver). They can never contain program logic.
      </p>
      <p>Some asides.
      </p>
      <p>First, I rejected using StringTemplate (or something like it) because it introduced some programming into the
        templating
        mechanism and it would have taken a lot of work to make it XMLTemplate (and all of Lift's templating is XHTML
        and
        makes use of Scala's excellent support of XML.) <strong>Note:</strong> Nowadays most templating is based on
        HTML5.
      </p>
      <p>Second, I've been referring to static templates. Lift has a little known and pretty much undocumented feature
        that
        supports template generation from Scala code. One of these days, I'll document the feature and put up some
        examples.
      </p>
      <p>Third, Rails' "controller first" dispatch mechanism makes the assumption that there is only one piece of
        "logic" on
        the page and the rest is decoration. My experience doing web work is just the opposite. There are typically 3
        or
        more of pieces of logic on a page (dynamic menu bars, search boxes, shopping cart, real-time chat, etc.) and
        having
        to choose which piece of logic make the "controller" is less than optimal.
      </p>
      <p>So, the quintessential use of Lift's templates are as follows:
      </p>
      <h3 id="myForm">Simple form example</h3>

      <div data-lift="Show?form=post">
        <div class="form-group form-row">
          <label for="name" class="col-form-label">Name</label>
          <div class="col">
            <input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Name" class="form-control">
          </div>
          <label for="birthyear" class="col-form-label">Birthyear</label>
          <div class="col">
            <select id="birthyear" class="form-control">
              <option>2006</option>
              <option>2007</option>
            </select>
          </div>
          <div class="col">
            <input type="submit" class="btn btn-primary" value="Submit" />
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="selectedyear"></div>
      <div id="namevalue"></div>
      <div id="wrappedNotice">
        <div data-lift="Msgs"></div>
      </div>
      <br>
      <span class="badge badge-secondary">HTML syntax</span>
      <pre class="html"><code>&lt;html&gt;
  ...
  &lt;form data-lift="Show?form=post" id="myForm"&gt;
     &lt;label for="name">Name&lt;/label&gt;
     &lt;input type="text" name="name" id="name" placeholder="Name"&gt;
     &lt;label for="birthyear">Birthyear&lt;/label&gt;
     &lt;select id="birthyear"&gt;
        &lt;option>2006&lt;/option&gt;
        &lt;option>2007&lt;/option&gt;
     &lt;/select&gt;
     &lt;input type="submit" value="Submit"/&gt;
  &lt;/form&gt;
  &lt;div id="selectedyear"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="namevalue"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div id="wrappedNotice"&gt;
    &lt;div data-lift="Msgs"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>


      <span class="badge badge-secondary">The older XHTML syntax</span>
      <pre class="html"><code>&lt;html&gt;
  ...
  &lt;lift:show.myForm form=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Name&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;f:name&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot;/&gt;&lt;/f:name&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Birthyear&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;
        &lt;f:year&gt;
          &lt;select&gt;
            &lt;option&gt;2007&lt;/option&gt;
            &lt;option&gt;2006&lt;/option&gt;
          &lt;/select&gt;
        &lt;/f:year&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Add&quot;/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/lift:show.myForm&gt;
  ...
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>

      <p>So we've got a Lift snippet invocation with the valid HTML form and some additional tags. So far (with the
        proper namespace
        declarations) this page is valid XHTML. This page can be viewed in a browser or opened and edited in
        Dreamweaver.
      </p>
      <p>In Lift, the snippet is the equivalent of a Rails controller: it is the instantiation of a class and
        invocation of
        a method on the class. Because you can have multiple snippets on a page, you can call out multiple logic
        streams
        on a given page and there's no need to choose the "primary" logic stream.
      </p>
      <p>The 'form="post"' attribute is a shortcut. It automatically wraps the enclosed XHTML in a &lt;form
        method='post' target={current
        page... it's a post-back}&gt;...&lt;/form&gt; tag.
      </p>
      <p>The &lt;f:.../&gt; tags are bind points for the business logic. They allow your snippet to easily replace the
        tag and
        its children with what is supposed to be displayed. This mechanism is a little heavier than Wicket's mechanism
        for
        binding display elements to logic and I've got a to-do to make Lift's mechanism work like Wickets as well...
        but
        that's a digression.
      </p>
      <p>So, your Lift code will look like:
      </p>

      <span class="badge badge-secondary">Lift 3.x syntax</span>
      <pre class="scala"><code>class Show {
  def render = {
    "#birthyear" #> SHtml.ajaxSelect(Show.yearsOptions,
                                     Show.yearsDefault,
                                     Show.yearsHandler) &
      "name=name" #> SHtml.ajaxText("", false, Show.nameHandler _) &
      "type=submit" #> submit("Submit", Show.submitHandler _)
  }
}

object Show {
  private var name: String = ""
  private var year: Int = 0
  val years: Map[String, Int] = Map("2006" -> 2006,
                                    "2007" -> 2007,
                                    "2008" -> 2008,
                                    "2009" -> 2009,
                                    "2010" -> 2010)
  val yearsOptions: List[(String, String)] = ("" -> "") :: years.keys
    .map(p => (p, p))
    .toList
  val yearsDefault = Empty
  // The function to call when an option is picked:
  def yearsHandler(selected: String): JsCmd = {
    this.year = years(selected)
    S.notice("Selected year '" + years(selected) + "'")
    SetHtml("selectedyear",
            &lt;div&gt;{"Selected year '" + years(selected) + "'"}&lt;/div&gt;)
  }
  def nameHandler(name: String): JsCmd = {
    this.name = name
    S.notice("The name is '" + name + "'")
    SetHtml("namevalue", &lt;div&gt;{"The name is '" + name + "'"}&lt;/div&gt;)
  }
  def submitHandler(): JsCmd = {
    S.notice(
      "The name and year was set to (" + this.name + "," + this.year + ")")
    S.redirectTo("#myForm")
  }
}</code></pre>

      <span class="badge badge-secondary">Older Lift syntax</span>
      <pre class="scala"><code>class Show {
   def myForm(xhtml: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = {
     var name = &quot;&quot;
     def handleYear(year: String) {
       ... the form's been submitted... do something
     }
     Helpers.bind(&quot;f&quot;,
                  xhtml,
                  &quot;name&quot; -&gt; SHtml.text(name, name = _),
                  &quot;year&quot; -&gt;
                    SHtml.select((1900 to 2007).toList.reverse
                                   .map(v =&gt; (v.toString, v.toString)),
                                 Empty,
                                 handleYear _)
                  )
   }
}</code></pre>

      <p>Note that no display code has crept into the snippet. You've simply bound the HTML created by text() and
        select() to
        the &lt;f:name/&gt; and &lt;f:year/&gt; tags in the incoming XHTML.
      </p>
      <p>Also, you've bound two functions (the anonymous function
        <code>name = _</code> and handleYear) to the HTML form elements. When the form is POSTed, these functions
        (which are bound
        to local variables) will be statefully invoked.
      </p>
      <p>If you are displaying a table rather than a form, then the same binding logic still works. For example:
      </p>

      <span class="badge badge-secondary">HTML syntax</span>
      <pre class="html"><code>&lt;table data-lift="show:users"&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;&lt;span id="first_name"&gt;David&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt;&lt;span id="last_name"&gt;Pollak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>

      <span class="badge badge-secondary">The older XHTML syntax</span>
      <pre class="html"><code>&lt;table&gt;

&lt;lift:snippet type=&quot;show:users&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;f:first_name&gt;David&lt;/f:first_name&gt;&lt;/ 
td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;f:last_name&gt;Pollak&lt;/f:last_name&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/lift:snippet&gt;

&lt;/table&gt;</code></pre>


      <pre class="scala"><code>class Show {
   def users(xhtml: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = Users.findAll.flatMap(user =&gt; bind(&quot;f&quot;, 
             xhtml, &quot;first_name&quot; --&gt; user.firstName, &quot;last_name&quot; --&gt; user.nameName))
}</code></pre>

      <p>If you take the time to clearly define the bind points, then you can have no display code at all in your
        snippets.
      </p>
      <p>Can display logic slip into a snippet? Yes, and as you've seen and pointed out, the examples are less than
        optimal
        in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>Has display logic ever crept into a method called from an ERB template? Yes, and very often it's a source of a
        potential
        Cross Site Scripting vulnerability.
      </p>
      <p>Has business logic ever crept into an ERB template? Yes.
      </p>
      <p>In Lift, display can creep into a snippet, but business logic cannot creep into a the static display template.
        Yes,
        your designers will still have to police putting display logic in the snippet code, but the coders will not
        have
        to police business logic in the templates.
